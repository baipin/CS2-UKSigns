  <LongDescription>UK Signs Pack  

### Outstanding Features
* Covering various kinds of traffic signs in UK.
* **Non-illustration Traffic Bollard (NRTB)** is included, and it's very realistic!
* **Very convenient to use.** The template is already there, and you just need to change the texts.

## Important: (If you want to use speed limit LED, After adding to playset...
You need to import the electric number font included in the mod by yourself. But it is very easy, just do like this:  
* Enter your savegame.
* Click the Write Everywhere buttom on the left-top (A circled "W").
* Choose "CITY FONTS" tab.
* Click "+", choose the puzzle-piece icon (Templates from mods). And search for the "baipinUKS" Mod.  
* Select "Speed LED(nums only).ttf"(for Speed limit LED), click "OK".
* You are done!

## Recommended structures
For overhead direction signs, you can use one or both of the following assets:
* [Highway Sign Frame Pack](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/127597/Any) by me.
* [Highway Sign Structures](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/127499/Any) by lolok.
  
There might be some differences for pre-layouts, but you can simply adjust manually.

## How to Use
1️⃣Install "Write Everywhere" first.(See link below)  
2️⃣Place a road structure (e.g. "European No Entry sign" for Round Micro Signs) that matches your sign type.  
3️⃣Open the Write Everywhere menu (CTRL + Shift + W).  
4️⃣Click the structure you want to edit.  
5️⃣Click Import layout from XML at root...  
6️⃣Choose the puzzle-piece icon (Templates from mods).  
7️⃣Search for the "baipinUKS" Mod.  
8️⃣Select a layout and customize it to your liking.  

## Customize and Save Signs
1️⃣Select the root object → Save and Export as XML.  
2️⃣Templates can be reused across cities and saves.  
3️⃣All templates are stored locally so no re-import required.  

## Notes
* The font for speed limit sign is Electrolize (Numbers only). The font is free to use and the combination into the module is allowed by its license.
* (Optional) English font "Transport" is recommended. But due to the copyright issue, please download and import by yourself.  (Copy the .ttf file to C:\Users\[Your username]\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\.Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\fonts, if no "fonts"dictionary, please create one.)
